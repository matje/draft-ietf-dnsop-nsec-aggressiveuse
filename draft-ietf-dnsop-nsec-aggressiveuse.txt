                      Aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse-00

Abstract

   DNS is highly dependent upon cache.  However, its cache of non-
   existent information has historically been limited to exact
   matches.This draft proposes the aggressive use of a NSEC/NSEC3
   resource record, which is able to express non-existence of a range of
   names authoritatively.  With this proposal, NXDOMAIN DNS reponse can
   be returned to the resolvers promptly.  It is also expected that
   queries for non-existent information to authoritative DNS servers DNS
   servers, including Root and TLD servers, will decrease.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


1.  Introduction

   A DNS negative cache does currently exist, and is used to cache
   negative existence.  This method of negative caching requires exact
   matching, in most cases [RFC2308].  This leads to unnecessary
   additional lookups, which have negative implications for DoS,
   increase latency, and lead to extra resource utilization on both the
   authoritative and recursive servers.

   This document proposes a minor change to RFC 4035 to allow recusrive
   resolvers to use NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to aggressively cache
   negative answers.  This would allow such resolvers to repond with
   NXDOMAIN immediately if the name in question falls into a range
   expressed by a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record in the cache.

   Aggressive Negative Caching was first proposed in Section 6 of DNSSEC
   Lookaside Validation (DLV) [RFC5074] in order to find covering NSEC
   records efficiently.  Unbound [UNBOUND] has aggressive negative
   caching code in its DLV validator.  Unbound TODO file contains "NSEC/
   NSEC3 aggressive negative caching".

   Section 3 of [I-D.vixie-dnsext-resimprove] "Stopping Downward Cache
   Search on NXDOMAIN" and [I-D.ietf-dnsop-nxdomain-cut] proposed
   another approach to use NXDOMAIN information effectively.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Many of the specialized terms used in this document are defined in
   DNS Terminology [RFC7719].

   The key words "Closest Encloser" and "Source of Synthesis" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in The Role of Wildcards
   [RFC4592].

   The key word "Closest Encloser" is also defined in NSEC3 [RFC5155].

   The key words "Next closer name" in this document is to be
   interpreted as described in NSEC3 [RFC5155].

3.  Problem Statement

   The current DNS negative cache caches negative (non-existent)
   information, and requires an exact match in most instances [RFC2308].
   Assume that "example.com" zone doesn't have names such as



Fujiwara, et al.        Expires December 17, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


   "a.example.com" and "b.example.com".  When a full-service resolver
   receives a query "a.example.com" , it triggers a DNS resolution
   process and eventually gets NXDOMAIN and stores it into its negative
   cache.  When the full-service resolver receives another query
   "b.example.com", it doesn't match with "a.example.com".  So it will
   send a query to one of the authoritative servers of "example.com".
   This was because the NXDOMAIN response just says there is no such
   name "a.example.com" and it doesn't return any information for
   "b.example.com", or anything else under "example .com".  [TODO:
   Better example, and how the range would work (alphabetically).]

   Section 5 of [RFC2308] seems to show that negative answers should be
   cached only for the exact query name, and not (necessarily) for
   anything below it.

   Recently, DNSSEC [RFC4035] [RFC5155] has been practically deployed.
   With DNSSEC, two types of resource record (NSEC and NSEC3), along
   with their RRSIG records, represent authentic non-existence.

   For a zone signed with NSEC, it would be possible to use the
   information carried in NSEC resource records to indicate the non-
   existence of a range of names.  However, such use is discouraged by
   Section 4.5 of RFC 4035, however.  [TODO: Want to include any
   rationale?  Otherwise there might be a question of why do it here, if
   it was (validly?) discouraged in 4.5 of RFC 4035?]

   If the full-service resolver can use a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record to
   prove that names within a specified range do not exist, the full-
   service resolver can answer NXDOMAIN error immediately when the full-
   service resolver's cache contain matching NSEC/NSEC3 RRs.  In our
   example above, this would result in the authoritative server
   responding that there are no names below "example.com" -- if that
   were the response, then a separate query for "b.example.com" would be
   unnecessary.  [TODO: Is this the case?  If it is, then we should
   specify no names below example.com in the first paragraph of this
   section, or no single-letter names, or whatever the example is
   actually supposed to be.  In short, what wildcard would you be
   suggesting for aggressive use here? * or ? or other?]

   This will improve full-resolvers' performance for non-existent
   queries and decrease non-existent queries to authoritative servers.

4.  Proposed Solution

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


4.1.  Aggressive Negative Caching

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] shows that "In theory, a resolver could use
   wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses
   (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question
   expire.  However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking
   new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own.
   Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent
   view of the namespace".

   To reduce non-existent queries sent to authoritative DNS servers,
   this restriction could be relaxed, as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Once the records are validated, DNSSEC enabled full-service |
   |  resolvers MAY use NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate   |
   |  negative responses until their effective TTLs or signatures |
   |  for those records expire.                                   |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

   If the full-service resolver's cache have enough information to
   validate the query, the full-service resolver MAY use NSEC/NSEC3/
   wildcard records aggressively.  Otherwise, the full-service resolver
   MUST fall back to send the query to the authoritative DNS servers.

   If the query name has the matching NSEC/NSEC3 RR and it proves the
   information requested does not exist, the full-service resolver may
   respond with a NODATA (empty) answer.

4.2.  NSEC

   If a full-service resolver implementation supports aggressive
   negative caching, then it SHOULD support aggressive use of NSEC and
   enable it by default.  It SHOULD provide a configuration knob to
   disable aggressive use of NSEC.

   The validating resolver needs to check the existence of an NSEC RR
   matching/covering the source of synthesis and an NSEC RR covering the
   query name.

   If the full-service resolver's cache contains an NSEC RR covering the
   source of synthesis and the covering NSEC RR of the query name, the
   full-service resolver may respond with NXDOMAIN error immediately.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


4.3.  NSEC3

   NSEC3 aggressive negative caching is more difficult.  If the zone is
   signed with NSEC3, the validating resolver need to check the
   existence of non-terminals and wildcards which derive from query
   names.

   If the full-service resolver's cache contains an NSEC3 RR matching
   the closest encloser, an NSEC3 RR covering the next closer name, and
   an NSEC3 RR covering the source of synthesis, it is possible for the
   full-service resolver to respond with NXDOMAIN immediately.

   If a covering NSEC3 RR has Opt-Out flag, the covering NSEC3 RR does
   not prove the non-existence of the domain name and the aggressive
   negative caching is not possible for the domain name.

   A full-service resolver implementation MAY support aggressive use of
   NSEC3.  It SHOULD provide a configuration knob to disable aggressive
   use of NSEC3 in this case.

4.4.  Wildcard

   The last paragraph of RFC 4035 Section 4.5 discusses aggressive use
   of a cached deduced wildcard (as well as aggressive use of NSEC) and
   recommends that it is not relied upon.

   Just like the case for the aggressive use of NSEC discussed in this
   draft, we could revisit this recommendation.  As long as the full-
   service resolver knows a name would not exist without the wildcard
   match, it could answer a query for that name using the cached deduced
   wildcard, and it may be justified for performance and other benefits.
   (Note that, so far, this is orthogonal to "when aggressive use (of
   NSEC) is enabled").

   Furthermore, when aggressive use of NSEC is enabled, the aggressive
   use of cached deduced wildcard will be more effective; the aggressive
   NSEC use helps prove more names wouldn't exist without the wildcard
   through fewer external queries.  [TODO: I cannot parse the section of
   the prior sentence after the semicolon.]

   A full-service resolver implementation MAY support aggressive use of
   wildcards.  It SHOULD provide a configuration knob to disable
   aggressive use of wildcards.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


4.5.  Consideration on TTL

   The TTL value of negative information is especially important,
   because newly added domain names cannot be used while the negative
   information is effective.  Section 5 of RFC 2308 states the maximum
   number of negative cache TTL value is 3 hours (10800).  So the full-
   service resolver SHOULD limit the maximum effective TTL value of
   negative responses (NSEC/NSEC3 RRs) to 10800 (3 hours).  It is
   reasonably small but still effective for the purpose of this
   document, since it can eliminate significant amount of DNS attacks
   with randomly generated names.

5.  Possible side effects

5.1.  Decrease of root DNS server queries

   Aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource records may decrease queries to
   Root DNS servers.  [TODO: Make clear this is a feature, not a bug :-P
   ]

   People may generate many typos in TLD, and they will result in
   unnecessary DNS queries.  Some implementations leak non-existent TLD
   queries whose second level domain are different each other.  Well
   observed examples are ".local" and ".belkin".  With this proposal, it
   is possible to return NXDOMAIN immediately to such queries without
   further DNS recursive resolution process.  It may reduces round trip
   time, as well as reduces the DNS queries to corresponding
   authoritative servers, including Root DNS servers.

5.2.  Possible mitigation of random subdomain attacks

   Random sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks or
   NXDomain attacks) send many queries for non-existent information to
   full-service resolvers.  Their query names consist of random prefixes
   and a target domain name.  The negative cache does not work well, and
   thus targetted full-service resolvers end up sending queries to
   authoritative DNS servers of the target domain name.

   When the number of queries is large, the full-service resolvers drop
   queries from both legitimate users and attackers as their outstanding
   queues are filled up.

   For example, BIND 9.10.2 [BIND9] full-service resolvers answer
   SERVFAIL and Unbound 1.5.2 full-service resolvers drop most of
   queries under 10,000 queries per second attack.

   The countermeasures implemented at this moment are rate limiting and
   disabling name resolution of target domain names in ad-hoc manner.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


   If the full-service resolver supports aggressive negative caching and
   the target domain name is signed with NSEC/NSEC3 (without Opt-Out),
   it may be used as a possible countermeasure of random subdomain
   attacks.

   However, attackers can set the CD bit to their attack queries.  The
   CD bit disables signature validation and the aggressive negative
   caching will be of no use.

6.  Additional proposals

   There are additional proposals to the aggressive negative caching.

6.1.  Partial implementation

   It is possible to implement aggressive negative caching partially.

   DLV aggressive negative caching [RFC5074] is an implementation of
   NSEC aggressive negative caching which targets DLV domain names.

   NSEC only aggressive negative caching is easier to implement NSEC/
   NSEC3 aggressive negative caching (full implementation) because NSEC3
   handling is hard to implement.  [TODO: This says, x is easier to
   implemtnt, because y is hard to implement. -- Add detail, or
   otherwise fix.]

   Root only aggressive negative caching is also possible.  It uses NSEC
   and RRSIG resource records whose signer domain name is root.

   [I-D.wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop] proposed root only aggressive
   negative caching in order to decrease defects and standardize
   quickly.  The root zone has certain properties that make it a special
   case: It is DNSSEC signed and uses NSEC, the majority of the queries
   are "junk" queries, the rate of change is relatively slow, and there
   are no corner cases such as wildcards.  Because of these properties,
   [TODO: Sorry; i'm not sure what to fill in here.]

6.2.  Aggressive negative caching flag idea

   Authoritative DNS servers that dynamically generate NSEC records
   normally generate minimally covering NSEC Records [RFC4470].
   Aggressive negative caching does not work with minimally covering
   NSEC records.  Most of DNS operators don't want zone enumeration and
   zone information leaks.  They prefer NSEC resource records with
   narrow ranges.  When a flag shows a full-service resolver supporting
   the aggressive negative caching and a query has the aggressive
   negative caching flag, authoritative DNS servers can generate NSEC
   resource records with wider range under random subdomain attacks.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


   However, changing the range of minimally covering NSEC Records may be
   implemented by detecting attacks.  Authoritative DNS servers can
   answer any range of minimally covering NSEC Records with attention
   about zone information leak.  [TODO: I don't understand this
   paragraph, but it could well just be me.]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   Newly registered resource records may not be used immediately.
   However, choosing suitable TTL value will mitigate the delay concern,
   and it is not a security problem.

   It is also suggested to limit the maximum TTL value of NSEC / NSEC3
   resource records in the negative cache to, for example, 10800 seconds
   (3hrs), to mitigate this issue.  Implementations which comply with
   this proposal are recommended to have a configurable maximum value of
   NSEC RRs in the negative cache.

   Aggressive use of NSEC / NSEC3 resource records without DNSSEC
   validation may cause security problems.  It is highly recommended to
   apply DNSSEC validation.

9.  Implementation Status

   Unbound has aggressive negative caching code in its DLV validator.
   The author implemented NSEC aggressive caching using Unbound and its
   DLV validator code.

Appendix A.  Aggressive negative caching from RFC 5074

   Imported from Section 6 of [RFC5074].

   Previously, cached negative responses were indexed by QNAME, QCLASS,
   QTYPE, and the setting of the CD bit (see RFC 4035, Section 4.7), and
   only queries matching the index key would be answered from the cache.
   With aggressive negative caching, the validator, in addition to
   checking to see if the answer is in its cache before sending a query,
   checks to see whether any cached and validated NSEC record denies the
   existence of the sought record(s).

   Using aggressive negative caching, a validator will not make queries
   for any name covered by a cached and validated NSEC record.
   Furthermore, a validator answering queries from clients will
   synthesize a negative answer whenever it has an applicable validated
   NSEC in its cache unless the CD bit was set on the incoming query.

   Imported from Section 6.1 of [RFC5074].

   Implementing aggressive negative caching suggests that a validator
   will need to build an ordered data structure of NSEC records in order
   to efficiently find covering NSEC records.  Only NSEC records from
   DLV domains need to be included in this data structure.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                   June 2016


Appendix B.  Detailed implementation idea

   Section 6.1 of [RFC5074] is expanded as follows.

   Implementing aggressive negative caching suggests that a validator
   will need to build an ordered data structure of NSEC and NSEC3
   records for each signer domain name of NSEC / NSEC3 records in order
   to efficiently find covering NSEC / NSEC3 records.  Call the table as
   NSEC_TABLE.

   The aggressive negative caching may be inserted at the cache lookup
   part of the full-service resolvers.

   If errors happen in aggressive negative caching algorithm, resolvers
   MUST fall back to resolve the query as usual.  "Resolve the query as
   usual" means that the full-resolver resolve the query in Recursive-
   mode as if the full-service resolver does not implement aggressive
   negative caching.

   To implement aggressive negative caching, resolver algorithm near
   cache lookup will be changed as follows:

   QNAME = the query name;
   QTYPE = the query type;
   if ({QNAME,QTYPE} entry exists in the cache) {
       // the resolver responds the RRSet from the cache
       resolve the query as usual;
   }

   // if NSEC* exists, QTYPE existence is proved by type bitmap
   if (matching NSEC/NSEC3 of QNAME exists in the cache) {
       if (QTYPE exists in type bitmap of NSEC/NSEC3 of QNAME) {
           // the entry exists, however, it is not in the cache.
           // need to iterate QNAME/QTYPE.
           resolve the query as usual;
       } else {
           // QNAME exists, QTYPE does not exist.
           the resolver can generate NODATA response;
       }
   }

   // Find closest enclosing NS RRset in the cache.
   // The owner of this NS RRset will be a suffix of the QNAME
   //    - the longest suffix of any NS RRset in the cache.
   SIGNER = closest enclosing NS RRSet of QNAME in the cache;

   // Check the NS RR of the SIGNER
   if (NS RR of SIGNER and its RRSIG RR do not exist in the cache
